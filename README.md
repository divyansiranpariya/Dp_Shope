# Dp Shop

##  Features:

#### Home
* The home page is essential for capturing the attention of potential customers and providing a seamless shopping experience.

####  descriptions
* The benefits of the customers interested in buying a product can check its details such as type, size, brand, color, description, stock, rating and warranty. They have all the information they need available in one place.

* One of the top mobile commerce app features is a shopping cart. A shopping cart allows customers to realize their purchase in several stages when they find it comfortable. For example, a user can add a product to the cart, and if they don’t want to proceed to checkout immediately, return to it easily. That way, adding products to the shopping cart once again isn’t necessary, saving customers their time.

### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.


```
lib/
|- screens/
|- utilities/
|- main.dart
```

### screens

This directory screens all the screen of the application together in one place. A separate file is created for each type as shown in example below:

```
screens/
|- CartProductData.dart
|- Home_page.dart
|- ProductDetails.dart
```

```

|- utilities/
    |- ProductData/
    |- StarRating/

```
```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project
